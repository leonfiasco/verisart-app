# verisart

I chose a MERN stack for this project.

# Time constraints
If I had more time I would've like to a redux store so that adding and removing a certificate could be displayed dynamically.
currently Im just reloading the browser once a certificate has been added, updated and deleted. 


I spent roughly 3 hours on this project split over two days.


when the mouse cursor hovers over the certicate an overlay will appear with the information, and the buttons for deleting and updating the respective certificate. 
the project is also responsive
